  > Agree with this article, codeing doesn't equal programming, what we need to do is focus on solving problems, not write code. AI will help us about code and replace coding position someday, we need to accept and adapt to it.
  
  > chatgpt improved version: I concur with the sentiments expressed in the article: coding is not equivalent to programming. Our focus should lie in problem-solving, rather than merely writing code. In the future, artificial intelligence will aid us in this regard and potentially supplant coding altogether. It is imperative that we acknowledge and adjust to this reality.
